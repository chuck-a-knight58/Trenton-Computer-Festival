#### Introduction to Python

Python is a very powerful programming language used in a variety of engineering and scientific settings.
Its popularity has spread in recent years mainly due to its ease of use and large collection of support libraries.

In this talk I'll provide a gentle introduction to the language using a hands on, demonstrative approach.
By the end of this talk, attendees should know how to get started with writing simple scripts in Python, and
have a general understanding of the Python ecosystem.

#### Pythonic Object Oriented Development

Object-Oriented Programming is a widely used concept to write powerful applications in many languages.

In this talk tackle the basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Python: exploring classes, objects, instance 
methods, attributes and much more!

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
