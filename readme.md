#### Introduction to Python (repeat of 2018 talk)

Python is a very powerful programming language used in a variety of engineering and scientific settings.
Its popularity has spread in recent years mainly due to its ease of use and large collection of support libraries.

In this talk I'll provide a gentle introduction to the language using a hands on, demonstrative approach.
By the end of this talk, attendees should know how to get started with writing simple scripts in Python, and
have a general understanding of the Python ecosystem.
